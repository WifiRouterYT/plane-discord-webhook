# plane-discord-webhook
middleman to convert https://plane.so/ webhooks into discord webhooks or something idfk

heavy WIP

how to run (assuming you know how to setup a webhook and your app is open to the internet):
* copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all of the values
* clone repo and run `npm i` to install all packages
* run `node index.js` and you should be good
